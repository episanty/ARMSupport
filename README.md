ARMSupport
==========
A support suite for Analytical *R*-Matrix calculations.

Â© Emilio Pisanty 2014-2016

This package provides functions for an implementation of the Analytical *R*-Matrix theory of photoionization (ARM), including detailed handling of integration contour paths for correct navigation of branch cut landscapes where relevant.

The ARM theory is comprehensively developed in the papers

The handling of the integration contour path to avoid branch cuts where they are present is described in detail in

This package consists of the Mathematica notebook `ARMSupport.nb`, and the auto-generated package file `ARMSupport.m`. For guidance on its use, see the implementations that use the package, which include
